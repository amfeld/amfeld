### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alex, 

and I am currently studying Computer Engineering in my Masters (as a minor). 
Iâ€™m currently learning programming with Java and Python and working on small little porjects to understand how to code. 
Fun fact: I am interested in smart home applications and I also have my own Homebridge and PiHole running on a RaspberryPI.
